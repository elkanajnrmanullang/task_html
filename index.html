            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Elkana Juanro Manullang, an active student in semester 5 or year 3 majoring in Information
                Engineering, Sumatra Institute of Technology. During college I mastered quite a lot of hard skills such
                as designing and designing websites, creating website databases, several programming languages, and so
                on.

                Hard skills here are not just theoretical but also applied in the field. In my free time between college
                and holidays, I fill my free time by creating websites and at the same time learning to put into
                practice the theory that I have learned from several online courses that I have taken. Currently I am
                also working on the side with my sister's agency, where I was asked to create a website according to the
                client's request.

                    <h4>Web Design</h4>
                    <p>I have pretty good web design skills. My experience in building websites
                        shows that I already have a strong foundation in this field. Although still considered
                        intermediate, I have succeeded in realizing design ideas into a real product. By
                        continuing to learn and practice, I have the potential to develop this ability even further.

                    <h4>Front End Web</h4>
                    <p>As a front-end developer, I have a pretty good ability in designing and building the visual
                        appearance of a website. By mastering HTML, CSS, and the basics of JavaScript, I am able to
                        create a user-friendly and responsive user interface.

                    <h4>Responsive Web Design</h4>
                    <p>I have a strong ability in responsive web design, ensuring that the websites I create can adapt
                        to various screen sizes. Using CSS media queries and frameworks such as Bootstrap, I can create
                        optimal displays on desktop, tablet, and smartphone devices.

                <p>During August to September, our team worked hard to create an innovative website for the Bali State
                    Polytechnic Web Design Competition. By combining minimalist aesthetics and cutting-edge technology,
                    our website delivers an intuitive and immersive user experience. The interactive features we
                    developed aim to increase user engagement and provide relevant information in an engaging way.

                <h3>Giri Senang - Kopi Palasari</h3>
                <p>During July to August, I collaborated with Kopi Palasari to enhance their brand image
                    through the development of a company profile website. Within a month, I successfully
                    designed and built a modern and informative website, presenting Kopi Palasari's unique story and
                    values. This website not only increases brand visibility in the digital world, but also provides a
                    better user experience.

                <p>As a form of support for the family business, I developed a website for Toko Sinar Jaya in the period
                    of November to December 2023. This website is designed with an attractive appearance and easy
                    navigation, so that customers can easily find the products they are looking for. In addition, this
                    website is also equipped with a blog feature to share information related to products and

                <p>For one week, I worked on a personal profile website creation project. This website is designed
                    with a minimalist and modern look, and is equipped with a blog feature to share
                    articles related to my field of interest.
